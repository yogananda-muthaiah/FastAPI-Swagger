# FastAPI-Swagger

Installation
First things first, make sure you have FastAPI installed. If not, you can install it using pip: 
```
pip install fastapi
```
Additionally, you’ll need an ASGI server to run your FastAPI application. For this example, we’ll use Uvicorn: 
```
pip install uvicorn
```
Now, let’s run our FastAPI application using Uvicorn: 
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
